# Snake-game
An arcade type snake game in the browser using JavaScript and p5.jp library

## How to play
1. Download all files onto the desktop.
2. Open index.html in your browser of choice.
3. Press [ENTER] to start.

## FAQ
### Why doesn't the game start when I open the index.html file?
I wanted to add this game to a blog post as an overlay. The blog post was supposed to explain how the game was done and then ask the user to press [ENTER] to launch it.

### Why did you make this? Does the world need another snake game?
I'm relatively new at programming and although I have some coding knowledge from books, I have never put it to use to create something more than "Hello world!".

If you would like to check my code and **give me some tips on how to make it better**, you are totally welcome. I probably butchered this thing. ;)
