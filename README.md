## FAQ
### Why did you make this? Does the world need another snake game?
I'm relatively new at programming and although I have some coding knowledge from books, I have never put it to use to create something more than "Hello world!".

If you would like to check my code and **give me some tips on how to make it better**, you are totally welcome. I probably butchered this thing. ;)

## Known bugs
- The menu text and the snake are the same color and they blend.
- Snake food can be generated on top of the snake.

## Versions
**v1.10** – Snake controls fixed. You can't turn the snake by 180 degrees on spot anymore by pressing two buttons one after the other in less than 0.1 seconds.

**v1.00** – First game.
